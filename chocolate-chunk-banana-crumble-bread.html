      <h1>Chocolate Chunk Banana Crumble Bread</h1>
      <h2>Picking the Right Bananas</h2>
      <p>Dozens of banana breads later, I have finally perfected my banana picking skills.
          This receipe does not have a lot of added sugar (sometimes I leave the sugar out entirely),
          so the key to still having a sweet and flavourful banana bread is really really ripe bananas.
      </p>
      <h3>Steps for the perfect baking bananas</h3>
      <ol>
            <li>Ripen Bananas at Room Temperture until VERY Spotty (reduced to clear bananas are ususally perfect)</li>
            <li>Put Bananas in the freezer overnight (or longer, I've stored mine for up to 3 months and they did not lose flavour)</li>
            <li>Defrost Bananas in Fridge overnight or at room temperture for at least 5 hours (bananas should be fully defrosted, even leaking slightly)</li>
      </ol>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat Oven to 350F</li>
        <li>Roughly chop dark chocolate bar until you have small chunks. I like to keep mine about the size of a hazelnut but you decide how small you want to chop them.</li>
        <li>Mix wet ingredients together: Bananas, Eggs, Vanilla Extract, Brown Sugar.</li>
        <li>Mix dry ingredients: Almond Flour, Ground Flax Seeds, Baking Powder, Cinnamon, Salt.</li>
        <li>Combine wet and dry ingredients until you have a uniform batter.</li>
        <li>Fold in chocolate chunks.</li>
        <li>Line baking dish with butter and pour in dough. Tap on counter a few times to reduce air pockets.</li>
        <li>Combine crumble ingredient in a bowl. Use your fingers to massage the cold butter into the sugar and oats. Stop when there are no more large butter chunks.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle crumble on top of the banana bread</li>
        <li>Bake for 30-35 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let cool for about 15 minutes and enjoy! </li>
        <li>I usually store mine in the fridge and reheat in the microwave for about 40 seconds. It should be good for at least 3-4 days, if it lasts that long!</li>
    </ol>
